                EZShop is a brick-and-mortar modular shopping infrastructure that provides customers with a
                completely
                frictionless shopping experience. Inspired by the recent innovations revealed by Amazon Go, our team
                ambitiously wanted to recreate the same experience - on a student budget. Furthermore, we wanted to
                innovate and go one step further - users of Amazon Go have to scan in and out of the store with a
                barcode to verify their identity. We wanted to remove that friction as well, and we did. With just
                everyday mobile devices, and a Raspberry Pi, we created EZShop.

                The proof-of-concept that we actually created is incredibly true to our vision - we have built a
                revolving-door shopping system where individuals register into our database by providing only their
                name and a picture of themselves. Customers can then enter our shop by simply walking by the camera
                stationed at our entrance, and can pick up an item and have it automatically added to their cart.
                Items are detected as picked up by placing light sensors and ultrasound under their respective
                racks.

                You give us a price that you want to spend and the radius that you are willing to walk or drive to
                a restaurant; then voila! We give you suggestions based on what you can get in that price in
                different restaurants by providing all the menu items with price and calculated tax and tips!
                We keep the user history (the food items they chose) and by doing so we open the door to
                crowdsourcing massive amounts of user data and as well as the opportunity for machine learning so
                that we can give better suggestions for the foods that the user likes the most! But we are not
                gonna stop here! Our goal is to implement the following in the future for this app:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We can connect the app to delivery systems to get the food for you!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inform you about the food deals, coupons, and discounts near you

                users to seek detailed restaurant menu items around them that fit within their preferred
                budget (after tax and tip) by inputting it into the application alongside a given radius.
